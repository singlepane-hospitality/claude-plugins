# Singlepane detailed-financials layouts (USALI account reference)

These are the canonical report layouts from Singlepane's own **Detailed Financials** UI,
extracted directly from the application source. Use them as the authoritative source of
USALI account strings when defining `financials` query variables, and as the default row
structure when a document contains a P&L or department table.

Every string in the **USALI string (exact)** column is the literal value for the
`usali` field of a financials query variable. **Copy them verbatim** — the ` - NNN`
department suffix is part of the string, and several strings contain irregularities
that must be preserved exactly:

- `Total Banquets Beverage- 200` — no space before the dash.
- `Mgmt Hours Worked  - 000` and `Non Mgmt Hours Worked  - 000` — **two** spaces before the dash.
- `Workers’ Compensation Insurance - 100` — curly apostrophe (but the 000-level `Workers Compensation Insurance - 000` has none).
- `ELECTRIC (KWH)`, `GAS (THERMS)`, `WATER (GALLONS)` — utility consumption stats with no department suffix.

### How to read the tables

The layout files were written for the Excel skill; map their conventions to docs:

- **SECTION HEADER** rows are display-only headings (no account behind them) — in a
  document table, plain bold text rows with no tag.
- **bold/subtotal** marks totals/subtotals. The subtotal accounts are real USALI lines
  (the platform computes them), so pull them as their own query variables rather than
  summing detail rows in computed variables — details may not tie exactly to the
  platform total.
- **KPI** rows (Occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, …) are *derived*: define them as computed
  variables using the division in the Notes column (Occupancy = `Total Rooms Sold - 100`
  ÷ `Total Rooms Available - 100`; ADR = `Total Revenue - 100` ÷
  `Total Rooms Occupied - 100`; RevPAR = `Total Revenue - 100` ÷
  `Total Rooms Available - 100`). Where a Notes cell shows an Excel formula, read it
  as the arithmetic recipe for a computed variable.
- The same account can appear more than once (e.g. `Total Revenue - 100` under ADR,
  RevPAR, and the Rooms revenue line) — the row label and KPI math distinguish them;
  one query variable can feed several computed variables and tags.

### Department suffix decoder

The ` - NNN` suffix encodes the USALI department:

| Suffix | Department |
|---|---|
| 100 | Rooms |
| 200 | Food & Beverage (all outlets consolidated) |
| 201–225 | Individual F&B outlets (see the F&B Outlets section; 212 = Minibar, reported under Other Operated; 220 is unused) |
| 300 | Other Operated Departments (total) |
| 310 | Health Club/Spa |
| 320 | Parking |
| 330 | Recreation |
| 340 | Retail |
| 350 | Guest Communications |
| 360 | Laundry & Dry Cleaning |
| 370 | Minor Operated Department-3 ("Other Operated Department") |
| 380 | Minor Operated Department-4 ("Misc. Minor Operated Department") |
| 390 | Golf Course & Pro Shop |
| 400 | Miscellaneous Income |
| 500 | Administrative & General |
| 600 | Information & Telecom Systems |
| 700 | Sales & Marketing (incl. Franchise Fees) |
| 800 | Repairs & Maintenance (Property Operations) |
| 810 | Utilities |
| 900 | Non-Operating income & expenses (rent, taxes, insurance, FX, other) |
| 910 | Interest, Depreciation & Amortization |
| 920 | Management Fees |
| 930 | FF&E Replacement Reserve |
| 940 | House Laundry (labor) |
| 950 | Staff Dining (labor) |
| 000 | Property-level totals & KPIs (Total Revenue, GOP, EBITDA, NOI, total labor, …) |

## Layout files — read ONLY the one(s) you need

Each report layout lives in its own file under `layouts/`. To keep responses fast,
read just the file(s) for the view being built — never all of them.

| View | File | ~rows |
|---|---|---|
| Summary | [layouts/summary.md](layouts/summary.md) | 62 |
| Rooms | [layouts/rooms.md](layouts/rooms.md) | 186 |
| Consolidated F&B | [layouts/consolidated-fb.md](layouts/consolidated-fb.md) | 133 |
| F&B Outlets (per-outlet template) | [layouts/fb-outlets.md](layouts/fb-outlets.md) | 163 |
| F&B Revenue Details | [layouts/fb-revenue-details.md](layouts/fb-revenue-details.md) | 560 |
| Other Operated Dpt. | [layouts/other-op-dpt.md](layouts/other-op-dpt.md) | 99 |
| Misc. Income | [layouts/misc-income.md](layouts/misc-income.md) | 18 |
| A&G | [layouts/a-g.md](layouts/a-g.md) | 93 |
| I&T | [layouts/i-t.md](layouts/i-t.md) | 96 |
| S&M | [layouts/s-m.md](layouts/s-m.md) | 93 |
| R&M | [layouts/r-m.md](layouts/r-m.md) | 90 |
| Utilities | [layouts/utilities.md](layouts/utilities.md) | 28 |
| Non-Operating | [layouts/non-operating.md](layouts/non-operating.md) | 25 |
| Labor | [layouts/labor.md](layouts/labor.md) | 102 |

## Choosing the right view

- **Summary** is the default for an owner/executive P&L — KPIs down to net income,
  all at department-total level. For slide decks, a curated subset of Summary rows
  (revenue, GOP, EBITDA, NOI, KPIs) is usually right — a 62-row table doesn't fit a
  slide; full schedules belong in Word appendices.
- The **department tabs** (Rooms, Consolidated F&B, Other Operated Dpt., Misc. Income,
  A&G, I&T, S&M, R&M, Utilities, Non-Operating) are the detailed schedules behind each
  Summary line — use them when the user wants a departmental schedule or a specific
  expense line.
- **F&B Outlets** (template, depts 201+) gives a full P&L for one outlet; **F&B
  Revenue Details** lists revenue lines for all outlets at once.
- **Labor** is the property-wide labor cost and hours view (000-level totals with
  per-department breakdown, including 940 House Laundry and 950 Staff Dining).
- When you only need a top-line number (Total Revenue, GOP, EBITDA, NOI), use the
  000-suffix account from the Summary layout rather than summing departments.
