# F&B Outlets (per-outlet template) — Singlepane detailed-financials layout

Read [../usali-layouts.md](../usali-layouts.md) first for how to read this table,
exact-string traps, and KPI-row recipes. USALI strings must be copied verbatim into
SP.FINANCIALS.

The UI generates this tab dynamically, one outlet department at a time, from a single
template: every account is the same line item with the outlet's department number as the
suffix. In the table below `{dept}` is the outlet department number — substitute `201`,
`202`, etc. to get the exact string (e.g. `Total Revenue - {dept}` → `Total Revenue - 201`).
Outlet departments and their standard names:

| Dept | Outlet | Dept | Outlet |
|---|---|---|---|
| 201 | Restaurant | 202 | Bar |
| 203 | Fine Dining | 204 | Market |
| 205 | Pool Bar | 206 | Local Restaurant |
| 207 | Rooftop | 208 | Misc. Outlet 1 |
| 209 | Executive Lounge | 210 | Misc. Outlet 2 |
| 211 | Room Service | 213 | Banquets |
| 214 | Catering | 215 | Convention Services |
| 216 | F&B Overhead | 217 | Non-Departemental F&B |
| 218 | Other Restaurant | 219 | Leased Restaurant |
| 221 | Other Restaurant #1 | 222 | Other Restaurant #2 |
| 223 | Other Restaurant #3 | 224 | Cafe |
| 225 | Market #2 |  |  |

(212 = Minibar also exists but is reported on the Other Operated Dpt. tab; 220 is unused.
Not every account exists for every outlet — rows below note the exceptions. A missing
account for a given outlet simply returns no data.)
